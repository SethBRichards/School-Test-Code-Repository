Contains the MATLAB code I wrote when learning the language through following class tutorials with real world applications. These files 
show I can comfortably create and edit mutiple styles of charts, perform complex math and solve ODEs, and work independently to
achieve my goals.

This class culminated in my final project, which revolved around creating a Mandelbrot plot with no outside help or resources. The 
project not only goes over how to create such a plot, but also how to do some operations to change how the client sees the plot.
