# Basic Python Files
This directory contains some of the first python code I created just to get a hang of the language, and test out some basic libraries. 

For the most part, this code is not well commented and does not follow good syntactic structure. 

That being said, combustionAnalysis.py is a good representation of what well written code I can make. It was adapted from an 
ALEKS chemistry question, and was meant to solve a complex ratio question based on given inputs.
