This folder contains code I created in my EE 235 signals and Systems class at UW in the lab, for lab assignments.

Each numbered lab has an associated jupyter notebook file for reference, and a pdf lab write-up file for viewing purposes.

These files demonstrate my understanding of signal analysis techniques in limited applications including convolutions, fourier transforms,
coherency checks, error squared coherency checks, and much more which is detailed in each lab write-up.

This code also shows the quality of my programming work, from efficiently handling data and commenting code, to using code to apply
theory to real world applications.

This code is from early 2020.
