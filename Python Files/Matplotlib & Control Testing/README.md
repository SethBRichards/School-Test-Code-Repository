# Matplotlib & Control Testing
This folder contains code I created early on in my coding career when I was trying to learn how to use the MatplotLib library, take inputs from keyboards and controllers, work with discrete and real time controls, and learn the basics of Python.

Since this code is from a long time ago, is not representitive of the quality work I can produce now. This is just to preserve some of what I've learned, and how far I've come.

This code is not well documented, legible, and is not implemented efficiently or even correctly in any way.
